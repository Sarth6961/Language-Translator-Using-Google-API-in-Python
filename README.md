# Language-Translator-Using-Google-API-in-Python
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It acts as an intermediate between two applications or software. In simple terms, API acts as a messenger that takes your request to destinations and then brings back its response for you. Google API is developed by Google to allow communications with their servers and use their API keys to develop projects.

In this tutorial, we are going to use Google API to build a Language Translator which can translate one language to another language. On the internet, we can see lots of projects on Speech Recognitions, Speech to text, text to speech, etc. but here in this project we are going to build something more advance than that. 

Let’s assume a scenario, we are traveling in Spain and we don’t know how to speak Spanish or we are in any other country and we don’t know their native language, then we can use this tool to overcome the problem. We can translate between all those languages which are present in google translator.
